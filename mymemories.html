				I feel very lucky to have got a chance to visit God's own country-Kerala. The freshness of air and lush green tea plantations which helped me in establishing a connect with Mother Nature. Spending a night on a houseboat was a thrilling experience. There was nothing but only clear water as far as the eye can see.</li>

			<li>The Andamans are another place where I made memories that will last me my lifetime. There I got a chance to do sea walking and snorkelling. These are some activities which I guess everyone should try atleast once in their life!</li>
